# Path-Finding-Algorithms
This is my take on popular path finding alogrithms ( Dijkstra's and A*). My python implementation is complete but is not very interactive. However, I designed my JavaScript implementation as user friendly and interactive as I can. 


Python Implementation
- the first mouse click will mark the start position and second the end position. Every mouse press after the first and second step will create the walls. 
- to initiate the path finding program, you'll need to press Space Bar. 
- the finding only works for one time running. You'll need to reload the python file if you want to run it multiple times.


JavaScript Implementation
- drag the blue icon in the "Add Start" button to anywhere on the grid to add the starting position.
- drag the gold icon in the "Destination" button at the top of the page to set the destired destination. 
- mouse click on any unoccupied squares on the gird will trigger the creation of walls (black squares). To stop the walls creation, press the left mouse button one more time or drag the pointer of the grid. 
- to remove walls, simple Right Click on the wall square you want to get rid of.
- You can choose the path finding algorithm in the drop down box. 
- to start the algoritm, simply click on "Run" button.
- you can change the location of the starting point and destination any time by relocating the blue and gold square anywhere on the gird.



ENJOY!
